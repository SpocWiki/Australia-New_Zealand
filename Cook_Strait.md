> Cook Strait (Māori: Te Moana-o-Raukawa, lit. 'The Sea of Raukawa') 
> is the strait that separates the North and South Islands of New Zealand. 
> 
> The strait connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest 
> with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast. 
> 
> It is 22 kilometres (14 mi) wide at its narrowest point, 
> and has been described as "one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world". 
> Regular ferry services run across the strait between Picton in the Marlborough Sounds and Wellington.
>
> The strait is named after James Cook, the first European commander to sail through it, in 1770. 
> The waters of Cook Strait are dominated by strong tidal flows. 
> The tidal flow through Cook Strait is unusual in that the tidal elevation at the ends of the strait 
> are almost exactly out of phase with one another, 
> so high water on one side meets low water on the other. 
> 
> A number of ships have been wrecked in Cook Strait with significant loss of life, 
> such as the Maria in 1851, the City of Dunedin in 1865, the St Vincent in 1869, 
> the Lastingham in 1884, SS Penguin in 1909 and TEV Wahine in 1968.
