## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Southern Alps** (Māori: Kā Tiritiri o te Moana; officially Southern Alps / Kā Tiritiri o te Moana) 
> are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, 
> reaching its greatest elevations near the range's western side. 
> 
> The name "Southern Alps" generally refers to the entire range, 
> although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.
>
> The range includes the South Island's Main Divide, 
> which separates the water catchments of the more heavily populated eastern side of the island 
> from those on the west coast. 
> 
> Politically, the Main Divide forms the boundary 
> between the Marlborough, Canterbury and Otago regions to the southeast 
> and the Tasman and West Coast regions to the northwest.
